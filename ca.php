<p><u>Your Rights and Choices </u></p>

rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your
 CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
<p><em>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</em></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Deletion Request Rights </em></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal 
information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain 
exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer 
request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) 
your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
<p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal 
information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions 
reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business 
relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>

exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided

<li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or 
statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other 
applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may

 if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
<li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
<li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em></p>
<p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request at <a href="contact.php">https://yescarloansca.net/contact.php</a>.</p>
<p>For DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION requests, please submit a verifiable consumer request at <a href="contact.php">https://yescarloansca.net/contact.php</a>.</p>
<p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of 
State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable 
consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make
 a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data 
portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer 
request must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify 
you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an 
authorized representative.</li>
<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal 
information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the 
request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a 
verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account 
with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable 
consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make
 the request.</p>
<p><em>Response Timing and Format</em></p>
<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 
days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will 
inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an
 account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. 
If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written 
response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we 
provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable 
consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain 
the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data 
portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal 
information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the
 information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable 
consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly 
unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell
 you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate 
before completing your request.</p>
<p><u>Non-Discrimination</u></p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, 
including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing 
penalties.</li>
<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or 
services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
</ul>

notify you by email or through a notice on our website homepage.</p>
