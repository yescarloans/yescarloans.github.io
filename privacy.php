<b>State Specific Disclaimers</b><br><br>

<u>California</u>: If married, you may apply for a separate, individual account.<br><br>

<u>Maine</u>: You have the right of free choice in the selection of the 
agent and insurer through or by which insurance in connection with a 
loan is to be placed. Obtaining insurance products from a particular 
agent or broker does not affect credit decisions by the lender, unless 
the insurance product you chose is not compliant with the lender's 
requirements.<br><br>

<u>New York</u>: A consumer report may be requested in connection to 
your application for credit by the lender your application is sent to. 
The lender (or its affiliates) may order additional consumer reports 
without further notice to you in connection with any update, renewal or 
extension of credit granted. You have the right to ask the lender 
whether it obtained a consumer report and, if so, the lender will 
provide you the name and address of the consumer reporting agency they 
used.<br><br>

<u>Ohio</u>: The Ohio laws against discrimination require that all 
creditors make credit equally available to all creditworthy customers 
and that credit reporting agencies maintain separate credit histories on
 each individual upon request. The Ohio Civil Rights Commission 
administers compliance with this law.<br><br>

<u>Rhode Island</u>: Credit reports may be obtained in connection with an application for credit.<br><br>

<u>Vermont</u>: You authorize any lender with whom your application is 
shared with (as well as their employees, agents and assignees) to obtain
 and verify information about you (i.e. credit reports, 
employment/banking information) that they may deem necessary or 
appropriate when evaluating your application. If your application is 
approved and credit is granted, you authorize the parties who granted 
the credit to obtain additional credit reports and other information 
about you in connection with reviewing the account (if applicable), 
taking collection on the account, or for any other legitimate purpose.<br><br>

<u>Wisconsin</u>: No provision of a marital property agreement, a 
unilateral statement under Wis. Stat. 766.59, or a court decree under 
Wis. Stat. 766.70, adversely affects the interest of the creditor unless
 the creditor, prior to the time the credit is granted, is furnished a 
copy of the agreement, statement or decree or has actual knowledge of 
the adverse provision when the obligation to the creditor is incurred.<br><br>
